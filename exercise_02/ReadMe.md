# Hungarian Algorithm for Tracking

This repository contains a solution for tracking objects in a video sequence using the Hungarian Algorithm. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem, which is fundamental in multi-object tracking.

## Introduction

Object tracking is a significant problem in computer vision with numerous applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and sports analytics. The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time, making it suitable for tracking multiple objects efficiently.
