# HOG Person Classifier

This repository contains a solution for detecting and classifying persons in images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a machine learning classifier.

## Introduction

This project aims to detect persons in images using the HOG feature descriptor combined with a machine learning classifier. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection.
