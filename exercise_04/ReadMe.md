# Supervised Segmentation

This repository contains a solution for image segmentation using supervised learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of a segmentation model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Introduction

Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label to each pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics. This project uses supervised learning to achieve accurate segmentation results.
