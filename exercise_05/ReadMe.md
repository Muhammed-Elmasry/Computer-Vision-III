# Unsupervised Segmentation

This repository contains a solution for image segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of an unsupervised segmentation model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction

Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label to each pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics. This project uses unsupervised learning to achieve accurate segmentation results without the need for labeled data.
