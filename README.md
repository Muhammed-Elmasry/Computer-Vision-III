## Exercise 01: HOG Person Classifier

### Introduction
This exercise involves detecting and classifying persons in images using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a machine learning classifier.

### Installation
```bash
cd exercise_01
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
Run the notebook to train the classifier and test it on sample images.
