# Re-ID using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This repository contains a solution for Re-Identification (Re-ID) using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The notebook demonstrates the implementation of a GNN-based approach to solve the Re-ID problem in computer vision.


## Introduction

Re-Identification (Re-ID) is the task of identifying the same object (e.g., a person) across different frames or cameras in a video surveillance system. This project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the Re-ID process.
